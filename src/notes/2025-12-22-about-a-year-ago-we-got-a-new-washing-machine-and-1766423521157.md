About a year ago we got a new washing machine and since then everytime the machine opens and closes the water valve there is a huge thud.  I did some research and apparently this is a common issue called water hammer.  It happens due the to rapid shut off of water and the back pressure slamming the pipes.  After some research I hopefully found the fix. [Water Hammer Assestors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09W1ZG9NR?psc=1&smid=A144MB2XYW5PKS)  They show up Xmas eve, so I probably won't install them till next week.  Fingers Crossed that they work.
