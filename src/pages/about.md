### Me

Hello! I'm the author of this blog. the blogging software Sia, and many more apps.  Mostly this site is just a test bed for Sia development but who knows maybe it will turn into something more.  

## This Site

This site is built with **Sia**, a simple and powerful static site generator.  I will write more Sia, a static site generator, but in the mean time you can check it out on [Github](https://github.com/terrymooreii/sia)
