### Me

Hello! I'm Terry Moore the author of this blog.  I originally started to put this together as a way for me to test out different features and functionality of my Static Site Generator call [Github](https://github.com/terrymooreii/sia).  But as time when on I stated to enjoy getting my random thoughts down as little Notes and bigger items as blog posts.  I have never really enjoyed writing or even making my thoughts public so this has been kinda therapeutic and educational.  

As for me I am a Frontend Engineer working at [Mezmo](https://mezmo.com) (formally LogDNA). I play on a few Beer League Ice Hockey teams.  I have a wife and a kid that is in college. (Ah time flies) Oh and a dog named Luna, she is a lab-coon hound mix.  


### Contact

Here is some some places on the internet that you can find me but to be honest I don't really do any social media.  I only keep my X account around since it was the first social media that I started to use. As you can see I don't have any Meta apps (no facebook, instagram, etc) and no tiktok.
