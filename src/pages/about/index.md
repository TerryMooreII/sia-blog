### Me

Hello! I'm Terry Moore, the author of this blog. I originally started this as a way to test out different features and functionality of my static site generator called [Sia](https://github.com/terrymooreii/sia). As time went on, I started to enjoy getting my random thoughts down as little notes and bigger items as blog posts. I've never really enjoyed writing or making my thoughts public, so this has been somewhat therapeutic and educational.

I'm a Frontend Engineer working at [Mezmo](https://mezmo.com) (formerly LogDNA). I play on a few beer league ice hockey teams. I have a wife and a kid in college. Oh, and a dog named Luna, who is a lab-coonhound mix.  



### Contact

Here is some some places on the internet that you can find me but to be honest I don't really do any social media.  I only keep my X account around since it was the first social media that I started to use. As you can see I don't have any Meta apps (no facebook, instagram, etc) and no tiktok.
