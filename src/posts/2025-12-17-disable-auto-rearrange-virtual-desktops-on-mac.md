Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use

To turn it off:

-Open System Settings
- Go to Desktop & Dock
- Scroll down to the Mission Control section
- Disable ✅ Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use

Once this is off, your virtual desktops (Spaces) will stay in a fixed left-to-right order and won’t reshuffle when you switch between them.
