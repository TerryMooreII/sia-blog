# Sia Blog 2.0

## Static site generator

About a year ago I created a static site generator just as a personal project and because I was bored. It worked kinda well but didnt have all the bells and whistles that I wanted.  Plus the code was kinda crap but it worked.  

So I decided to rewrite it.  It still supports markdown with front matter with templates rendered in nunjuks templates.  It comes with a default light and dark theme but all template files and css files are customizable. 

There are three types of content entries. First there are pages which are just that static pages like the about page. Next there are normal Blog posts and the finally Notes.  Notes are basically micro blog posts, think tweets, but stored locally.  

Currently you can added media, images, show code samples and even supports emojis :tada:

Check it out and if you have any feature requests let me. 

Thanks
