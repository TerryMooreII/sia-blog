excerpt: "I feed AI with the list of TV series I have watch to find out what I should binge next."
---

After cataloging the list of [TV series](../../../../tv-series/) that I have binge watched and using AI to clean up the tables and lists I decided to ask it what it thinks I should watch next.  The results, well see below, however they do contain two series that had planed on watching; The Wire and Succession.  I had just heard of True Detective recently and I thought that it sounded really interesting.  As for The Bear and Fargo, well I had heard of them but wasn't really interested but maybe I should be?!

## Here is what AI said and why it suggested them
