excerpt: "Here is the recipe for my game day chili.  I got this from Reddit a while back and have modified it slightly for more heat.  It's great on a cold day but even better on a game day."

- [ ] 1 (12 ounce) bottle dark beer
- [ ] 1 (14 1/2 ounce) can beef broth
- [ ] 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- [ ] 1 (4.5 ounce) can chopped green chiles
- [ ] 2 tablespoons chili powder
- [ ] 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

## Preparation

1. Cook first 3 ingredients in a Dutch oven over medium heat, stirring until meat crumbles and is no longer pink. Drain well.
2. Combine meat mixture, beans, and next 11 ingredients in Dutch oven
3. Bring to a boil. I will boil for 15-20 minutes stirring every minute or so to avoid it burning.  I do this to help remove some of the beer taste.  
4. Reduce heat, and simmer 3 hours or until thickened.


The Reddit post suggested to use Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and I 💯 agree
