## Personal

**TV**
About to finish season 2 of Landman.  I still like the series but the wife/daughter story line is annoying, actually its mostly the wife that is annoying.  They need less of that story and more oil related stuff.  I was reading IMDB reviews and the seems like a common consensus, Landman great, wife annoying.

My kid has started to watch The Office from start to finish, therefore I am kinda doing the same. Although he is way ahead of me but I have also seen all of these about 10 times.

**Music**
I use the [Jambase](https://jambase.com) app to keep track of the concerts I want to attend.  It has a nice feature that you can click on shows to add them to your calendar.  While this stores them in the app they do have a way to sync that with my Proton Calendar.  Anyway, I went through the next few months and added the upcoming shows to my calendar to attend.... Whether I do attend or not is yet to be seen.  

**Me**
I got the all clear on Thursday to start playing hockey again after my knee surgery. Now its time to see how out of shape I have gotten. Fingers crossed I don't hurt myself again.

## Professional

Nothing to really write about.  Last week we deployed the permissions updates in hopes to have it in prod this week. However we found a few issues that we needed to correct first.  Better to find then in dev or stage than our customers find them in prod.  I think we will be able to go to Int on ~Monday~ (holiday) Tuesday. Other than fixing that up just normal stuff, nothing interesting enough write about.
