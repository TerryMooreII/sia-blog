## Personal

**TV** Finished season 2 of Landman.  I really like the ending and I'm excited to see what next season holds. I didnt really watch anything else except hockey which is fine with me.  I have enjoyed watching the YouTube show called RobWords about the origin of words.  I previous talked about this with his stream about time that we really interesting and got me hooked.  Oh and a documentary about the BTK killer :shrug:.   

**Hockey**
I played hockey for the first time since my knee surgery last Sunday.  The knee felt really good while playing but was kinda swollen the next day but no real issues.  However I did get hit in the side of the leg durning the first period.  I thought it was just a charlie horse but it hurt like hell the next day.  Then after two games both knees are swollen and it hurts to go up and down stairs.  I plan on seeing the doctor again.  

**Personal** Well its official, I am old.  I went to the eye doctor for the first time in 10+ years due to my eye sight starting to fail while looking at a computer or really anything close.  The doctor prescribed eye glasses, I am actually kinda excited for them. 

I did read a cool article that was title something like, Your subscription is my weekend project. Its basically about ditching paid apps and just letting AI build something equivalent. As the author stated, these projects aren't production ready but work well enough for a personal need.  I really like that.  I have been thinking about building an RSS reader since I have really gotten into reading small personal blogs and just looking at personal websites.  

I uninstalled Reddit off my phone, it was really the last of the doom scrolling apps that I had on my phone. I still find myself picking up my phone during commercial breaks and then realizing there is nothing to see and putting it back down.  I love it!  

## Professional

Nothing to note, going to prod on Monday for the permissions stuff.  Everything else has been smaller fixes and features.  I am still not really sure what to think about AI for professional use.  I do use it a lot a work (and for personal projects) but I think it has taken the fun out of programming.
