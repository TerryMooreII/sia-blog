## Personal

**TV** Finished season 2 of Landman.  I really like the ending and I'm excited to see what next season holds.  

**Hockey**
I played hockey for the first time since my knee surgery last Sunday.  The knee felt really good while playing but was kinda swollen the next day but no real issues.  However I did get hit in the side of the leg durning the first period.  I thought it was just a charlie horse but it hurt like hell the next day.
